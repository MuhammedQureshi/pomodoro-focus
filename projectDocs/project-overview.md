- **Productivity Streaks:** Gamification elements to encourage consistency
- **Offline Support:** Next.js API routes and local caching for offline functionality
- **Notifications:** Browser notifications with permissions

## Technical Implementation

### Next.js Structure
- **Pages:** Route-based component structure for main views
- **API Routes:** Serverless functions for backend logic
- **Components:** Reusable UI elements and feature-specific components
- **Hooks:** Custom React hooks for timer logic and data fetching
- **Context/State:** Global state management for app-wide data

### Tailwind CSS Integration
- Custom theme configuration for brand colors and styling
- Component-based design system using Tailwind classes
- Responsive utilities for all viewport sizes
- Animation and transition utilities for interactive elements

### Supabase Implementation
- **Authentication:** User signup, login, and profile management
- **Database Tables:**
  - Users table (linked to auth)
  - Sessions table (storing completed pomodoros)
  - Tasks table (for associated work items)
  - Settings table (user preferences)
- **Real-time Subscriptions:** Live updates for active sessions
- **Storage:** Backup and export functionality for user data
